# Project Rules and Conventions

## Package Management

- Always use pnpm for package management
- Lock file (pnpm-lock.yaml) must be committed
- Use semantic versioning (^) for better dependency management
- Regular updates through automated tools (Renovate)

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all files
- Enforce strict TypeScript mode
- Use ESLint with Next.js recommended rules
- Follow Prettier formatting
- Use named exports instead of default exports
- Use arrow functions for consistency

## UI Components

- Mobile-first approach for all components and layouts
- Design and test on mobile before desktop
- Use shadcn/ui as the primary component library
- Customize components through tailwind.config.ts
- Follow shadcn/ui's styling conventions
- Keep components atomic and reusable
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Ensure touch-friendly interactions
- Minimum tap target size of 44x44px
- Avoid hover-only interactions

## Responsive Design

- Start with mobile layout (375px width)
- Add breakpoints only when needed
- Use relative units (rem, em) over pixels
- Test on real mobile devices
- Consider network conditions
- Optimize images for mobile
- Ensure readable font sizes (min 16px)
- Account for touch interactions
- Consider offline capabilities

## Project Structure

- Follow the structure defined in PRD.md
- Keep components atomic and reusable
- Place types in separate .d.ts files
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for cleaner imports

## State Management

- Use React Query for server state

## Git Conventions

- Use conventional commits
- Branch naming: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/
- Squash commits when merging
- Write descriptive commit messages

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utilities
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Use React Testing Library for component tests

## Performance
